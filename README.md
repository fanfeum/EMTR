# Electromagetic time reversal (EMTR) and Machie Learning (ML)
Implementation of the hybrid EMTR/ML methods for rannhe of applications innclusing electromagnetic source localization, source recunstruction, and microwave imaging. 

## Getting started

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:fanfeum/EMTR_ML.git
cd EMTR_ML
```

## Loadig the data, extracting the feature vectors, and training the model

All is implemented in '1sesnor.ipynb'
