# Electromagetic time reversal (EMTR) and Machie Learning (ML)
Implementation of the hybrid EMTR/ML methods for a range of applications including electromagnetic source localization, source recunstruction, and microwave imaging. 

## 1. Single sensor EM Source localization using EMTR and deep transfer learning
Please refer to [paper](https://rdcu.be/b345w) for detailed explanation of the method.
### Getting started

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:fanfeum/EMTR_ML.git
cd EMTR_ML
```

### Loadig the dataset, extracting the feature vectors, and training the model
* Open jupyter notebook in the current directory:
```
jupyer notebook
```
* Open and run '1sesnor.ipynb'

### Visualizing the evaluation results

Run 'figureMaker.m' using Matlab
